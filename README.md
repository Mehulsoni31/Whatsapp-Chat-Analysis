Whatsapp Chat Analysis using NLP
Whatsapp has quickly become the worldâ€™s most popular text and voice messaging application. Specializing in cross-platform messaging with over 1.5 billion monthly active users, this makes it the most popular mobile messenger app worldwide.

I thought of various projects on which I could analyse data like - Air Quality Index or The cliched Covid-19 Data Analysis.

These would be some interesting insights for sure, more for me than for you, since the people in this chat are people I know personally.
